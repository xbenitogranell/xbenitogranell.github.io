## Project overview
Steamed by the hypothesis that modern deltas can survive future sea-level rise forced by warmer conditions if pulsing events can supply sediments,
waters, and nutrients, the objective of **DELTAPULSE** is to develop the methodological and paleoecological basis of deltaic ecosystem development. We
aim at determining which biotic and geological proxies for past deltaic pulse events are critical for sustainability of the Ebro Delta in the present and
future, validating them with basin and coastal environmental forcings driven by paleoclimate and historical human impacts. First, we will investigate past
environmental conditions under which coastal wetland developed using a restored ecosystem preceding 200 years of hydrologic presses and pulses
driven by rice fields and dams. Then, we will reconstruct natural drivers of delta ecosystem change over the last 10,000 years combining evidence at
catchment and delta scales, and studying the paleoecological signal of pulse events using a read-to-use, chronologically dated sediment core. We will
focus on an inversed modeling approach to identify flood layers, and biological and geochemical signatures that might be triggered by independent
paleoclimatic and sea-level histories. Finally, we will turn our attention to modelling future probabilities of delta natural habitats crossing critical
thresholdstransitioning from vegetated to submerged states. **DELTAPULSE** also includes a knowledge transfer plan to increase social awareness about
the complex long-term dynamics and adaptability of the Ebro Delta, and for efficient strategies relevant to stakeholders and ecosystem managers.
