** Community mobilization for a multidisciplinary paleo-database of the Global South [INQUA](https://www.inqua.org)**

## Project overview
The multi-year project “The whole is not the sum of the parts: building a synthesis database of past human-environmental systems in the Global South (pSESYNTH)” promotes international coordinated efforts to enhance paleo-scientific research, collaboration and application in the Global South.

The overarching goal of pSESYNTH is to establish, articulate and strengthen regional, interdisciplinary teams for studying past socio-environmental systems of the Global South through building the first multi-disciplinary paleo-database representing its regions.

Are you interested in joining pSESYNTH? Fill in this [form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSc0Wc3pNlUW_dG7cbUmQtBAM9YJz0maghX00QGRNkAYxgMPgQ/viewform) and we will get in contact with you.

pSESYNTH activities are being developed around three main objectives:

1. To explore what processes allow us to infer past drivers of environmental change using an interdisciplinary multiproxy approach, organized into three themes: paleoecology (e.g., pollen, charcoal, diatoms), paleoclimatology (e.g., biomarkers, stable isotopes, varves, numerical simulations), and archaeology (e.g., radiocarbon dates, phytoliths, archaeobotanical remains, material culture).

2. To quantitatively analyze the links among paleoecology, paleoclimatology and archaeology, with an emphasis on research questions that can be generic across the Global South (e.g., are there connections – or commonalities – between colonial legacies and the evolution of socio-environmental systems in the Global South?) or specific to each sub-region (e.g., at what spatial and temporal scales were human-environmental systems coupled or uncoupled to climatic fluctuations?).

3. To share the outputs and products of the project in the form of a database that meets the FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable) principles (Wilkinson et al. 2016). pSESYNTH participants will capitalize on existing single- and multi-themed databases (e.g., Neotoma, NOAA, PANGAEA, LinkedEarth, CARD, ArchaeoGlobe, HYDE 3.2), in complementing their contributions in the novel Global South database. Together, the FAIR-ICON principles will underpin the database organization and will ensure geographic coverage, comparability, and accessibility for time-series data synthesis, which is crucial for mainstreaming paleoscience research from the Global South.
