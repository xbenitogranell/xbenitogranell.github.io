## Project overview
The Anthropocene's onset, reflecting human-induced changes within natural archives, varies globally due to regional dynamics including historical events, natural processes, and human activities. Latin America's diverse ecology and previous research complexity necessitate a comprehensive review. Our work aims to consolidate knowledge of human traces in sedimentary archives across Latin America, addressing spatial and temporal variations, and synthesizing evidence applying interdisciplinary approaches (paleolimnology and archaeology)

## My role
I am part of the Latin American group contributing with experience on tropical Andes paleoecology looking at past human-environment interactions. I'm also helping to build a database of human traces in sedimentary records using an innovative research review that link proxies (e.g., diatoms), human traces (e.g., eutrophication) and human activities (agriculture) in a chronological framework shared with archaeology evidence from [ArchaeoGLOBE](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataverse/ArchaeoGLOBE)
