## My role
I am part of the Latin American group contributing with experience on tropical Andes paleoecology looking at past human-environment interactions. I'm also helping to build the database of human traces in sedimentary records using an innovative research review that link proxies (e.g., diatoms), human traces (e.g., eutrophication) and human activities (agriculture) in chronological framework of onset of land-use types [ArchaeoGLOBE]()
