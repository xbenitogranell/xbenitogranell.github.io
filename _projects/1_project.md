**Consolidación Investigadora research project (Ref: CNS2024-154895) (2025-2027) [Spanish State Research Agency](https://www.aei.gov.es)**

## Project overview
The purpose of DECISION is to test the pragmatic yet ambitious hypothesis that the onset and early rice cultivation and natural drivers of Ebro Delta long-term change and variability can be determined using a combination of aquatic palaeoecological proxies preserved in the sediments and Earth System’s modeling. First, we will examine past environmental conditions under which rice cultivation thrived following pre-dam and post-dam influences (last ca. 200 years). Then, we will reconstruct natural drivers of delta ecosystem change over the last 4000 years applying a combination of geochemistry (sediment provenance through XRF and foraminifera-based salinity paleoreconstructions) and modeling (past sea level curves and fluvial sediment discharges) methods. DECISION will finally translate past human-environmental dynamics to future simulations in the form of sensitivity maps to visualize where and when in the Ebro Delta natural and human-driven habitats may change.
