## Project overview
The purpose of DECISION is to test the pragmatic yet ambitious hypothesis that the onset and early rice cultivation and natural drivers of Ebro Delta long-term change and variability can be determined using a combination of aquatic palaeoecological proxies preserved in the sediments and Earth Systemâ€™s modeling. First, we will examine past environmental conditions under which rice cultivation thrived following pre-dam and post-dam influences (last ca. 200 years). Then, we will reconstruct natural drivers of delta ecosystem change over the last 4000 years applying a combination of geochemistry (sediment provenance through XRF and foraminifera-based salinity paleoreconstructions) and modeling (past sea level curves and fluvial sediment discharges) methods. DECISION will finally translate past human-environmental dynamics to future simulations in the form of sensitivity maps to visualize where and when in the Ebro Delta natural and human-driven habitats may change.

The code is simple.
Just wrap your images with `<div class="col-sm">` and place them inside `<div class="row">` (read more about the <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.4/layout/grid/">Bootstrap Grid</a> system).
To make images responsive, add `img-fluid` class to each; for rounded corners and shadows use `rounded` and `z-depth-1` classes.
Here's the code for the last row of images above:
