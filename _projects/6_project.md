## Project overview
This project incorporates conceptual elements of disturbance dynamics and trajectories of change in coastal lagoons through which pulsating and gradual phenomena affecting their hydrology, a key feature of Mediterranean coastal lagoons, generate variability in environmental gradients across space (within and between lagoons) and time (from weeks to decades and hundreds of years) as external factors of global change (e.g., sea level rise) influence their trajectories. The water-sediment continuum provides a unifying framework for this ecological analysis.
