We got a new research project **Generaci√≥n de Conocimiento 2025** funded by the [Spanish State Research Agency](https:///www.aei.gov.es). The overarching goal is to establish the links between deltaic pulse dynamics and ecosystem development at centennial and milenial time scales. See project's [DELTAPULSE](projects/9_project) description for more details and get in touch if you want to establish a collaboration on this topic.
