We aim at determining which biotic and geological proxies for past deltaic pulse events are critical for sustainability of the Ebro Delta in the present and future, validating them with basin and coastal environmental forcings driven by paleoclimate and historical human impacts. First, we will investigate past environmental conditions under which coastal wetland developed using a restored ecosystem preceding 200 years of hydrologic presses and pulses driven by rice fields and dams. Then, we will reconstruct natural drivers of delta ecosystem change over the last 10,000 years combining evidence at catchment and delta scales, and studying the paleoecological signal of pulse events using a read-to-use, chronologically dated sediment core. We will focus on an inversed modeling approach to identify flood layers, and biological and geochemical signatures that might be triggered by independent paleoclimatic and sea-level histories. Finally, we will turn our attention to modelling future probabilities of delta natural habitats crossing critical thresholdstransitioning from vegetated to submerged states. <strong>DELTAPULSE</strong> also includes a knowledge transfer plan to increase social awareness about the complex long-term dynamics and adaptability of the Ebro Delta, and for efficient strategies relevant to stakeholders and ecosystem managers.</p> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/deltapulse_objectives-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/deltapulse_objectives-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/deltapulse_objectives-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"></source> <img src="/assets/img/deltapulse_objectives.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" title="" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="caption"> DELTAPULSE workflow </div> <h2 id="my-role">My role</h2> <p>I am the principal investigator of the project.</p> <h2 id="team">Team</h2> <p><a href="mailto:xavier.benito@irta.cat">Contact me</a> if you are interested to explore BSc, MSc, or PhD opportunities around this topic and if have any questions <img class="emoji" title=":sparkles:" alt=":sparkles:" src="https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/2728.png" height="20" width="20"> <img class="emoji" title=":smile:" alt=":smile:" src="https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f604.png" height="20" width="20"></p> </body></html>
