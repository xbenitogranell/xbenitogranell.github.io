I am a biologist and environmental scientist currently pursuing a PhD at IRTAâ€™s Marine and Continental Waters Programme, supervised by Dr. Xavier Benito and Dr. Rosa Trobajo. My research focuses on the **taxonomy, ecology, and biogeography of diatoms**, and how climate and environmental change impact their diversity. I use microscopy and DNA-metabarcoding to monitor diatom communities as bioindicators.

My work is part of applied monitoring initiatives such as the Catalan Water Agency (ACA) program, which assesses freshwater quality across Catalonia, and the CONACAN project, the first to study diatom communities on the Canary Islands (La Palma, La Gomera, Tenerife).
