My research interests lie at the interface of **limnology, palaeoecology and biogeography** on questions related to how dynamics between biotic communities and their physical environment change through time. I’m fascinated in using aquatic communities such as **diatoms** and **foraminifera** with complementary geochemical and hydrological reconstructions from aquatic ecosystems that receive the influence of catchment, and climate and anthropogenic forcings across the **aquatic continuum**: from high-mountain lakes to river deltas.

As a biologist and environmental scientist by training, I’m also motivated by fundamental and applied questions of socio-ecological systems, particularly how human legacies explain whole-ecosystem trajectories: lake-basin and coastal-marine environments. I use data across spatial (local to continental) and temporal (decades to millennia) scales, involving quantitative multivariate analyses, geospatial and time series modelling.

I’m deeply interested in fostering **open data, facilitate the exchange of ideas and skill sets, and team science** to inform inform current climatic and sustainability issues using paleosciences. I’m co-leading and participating in different international research projects (see *projects*) in which I strive to apply these community mobilization aspects.
