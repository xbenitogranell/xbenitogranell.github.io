## Mentoring
My goal as a mentor is to engage students in scientific questions, study designs, and data analysis. I also strive to encourage team work among the students, so they can learn to work in a multidisplinary environment for understanding natural phenomena, and hence ecology.

**Undergraduate students**
I'm always keen to explore and help craft ideas for BSc and MSc final projects, including but not limited to freshwater and transitional biological communities and responses to environmental change, metacommunities and biogeography (i.e., local and regional drivers of change), and paleolimnology (i.e., multi-proxy time series analyses). Feel free to [email me](emailto:xavier.benito@irta.cat) if you are interested to co-design such a project together.

**Postdoctoral researchers**
If you think my research lines are a good fit for your interests, I'm also happy to start conversations in co-developing postdoctoral fellowships. Please [email me](emailto:xavier.benito@irta.cat) with a short summary of your research interests and ideas. Some potential fellowships include:
- [Marie Skłodowska-Curie Actions](https://marie-sklodowska-curie-actions.ec.europa.eu/calls/msca-postdoctoral-fellowships-2025)
- [Beatriu de Pinós Programm](https://agaur.gencat.cat/en/beques-i-ajuts/convocatories-per-temes/Ajuts-postdoctorals-Beatriu-de-Pinos-BP-2024) 3-year postdoctoral fellowship 
- [Juan de la Cierva](http://www.aei.gob.es/convocatorias/buscador-convocatorias/ayudas-contratos-juan-cierva-2024) 3-year postdoctoral fellowship (less than 2 years post PhD defense)



## Teaching activities

My teaching phylosophy is to raise curiosity and help students develop their scientific mindset by learning more the moment they step out of class. Between 2021 and 2024, I held an adjunct professorship at the [University of Barcelona](https://www.ub.edu), Department of Evolutionary Biology, Ecology, and Environmental Sciences, where I taught and coordinate BSc- and MSc-level courses in Environmental Sciences, Biology, and Marine Sciences.
