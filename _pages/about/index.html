I’m fascinated in using aquatic communities such as <strong>diatoms</strong> and <strong>foraminifera</strong> with complementary geochemical and hydrological reconstructions from aquatic ecosystems that receive the influence of catchment, and climate and anthropogenic forcings across the <strong>aquatic continuum</strong>: from high-mountain lakes to river deltas.</p> <p>As a biologist and environmental scientist by training, I’m also motivated by fundamental and applied questions of socio-ecological systems, particularly how human legacies explain whole-ecosystem trajectories: lake-basin and coastal-marine environments. I use data across spatial (local to continental) and temporal (decades to millennia) scales, involving quantitative multivariate analyses, geospatial and time series modelling.</p> <p>I’m deeply interested in fostering <strong>open data, facilitate the exchange of ideas and skill sets, and team science</strong> to inform inform current climatic and sustainability issues using paleosciences. I’m co-leading and participating in different international research projects (see <em>projects</em>) in which I strive to apply these community mobilization aspects.</p> </body></html>
