My PhD research at the IRTA Marine and Continental Waters program aims to bridge the gap between paleoecology and agroecology. As part of the DECISION and DELTAPULSE projects - under the supervision of Dr. Xavier Benito -  I will investigate the anthropogenic and natural forcings on the Ebro delta aquatic ecosystems over the last 12,000 years. Specifically, I will examine the impact rice farming had on the delta’s ecology by studying foraminifera and diatom responses to ‘pre’ and ‘post’ human settlement conditions.

With a MSc in Paleontology Paleoclimatology, and Paleoenvironments from the Université de Lille (France), I have a background in Holocene paleoenvironmental reconstructions of coastal environments, and a strong interest in quantifying natural vs anthropogenic impact on ecosystems since the Younger Dryas. I am eager to be part of this research initiative, which aims to use multi-proxy paleoenvironmental datasets to provide scientifically-informed background conditions for protection and conservation efforts in the Ebro Delta.
